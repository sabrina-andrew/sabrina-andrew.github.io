      In my current position, I take calls from customers to sell, service, maintain and renew Auto and Special Lines policies.  The ability to handle all aspects of the policy means fewer transfers, a better custome rexperience, and lower cost per policy.

                This was a team project.  We were broken into groups and given different tasks of running our own insurance agency. I choose to be the brand manager and created this logo. This project was fun and helped us all take more ownership in our work.

                Before I came to my current position, I would send out birthday emails to help celebrate my team mates special day. It is a fun way to be able to create some unity even though most of the team is working from home.

                For five weeks my team was split in half and played battleship. I was a team captain. Each time we had an effective cross sell call transfer, we got to take a shot at the other teams ships. Playing team games while taking calls is a really great way to have fun together at work. It created a work environment that was competitive and fun while instilling good habits of helping the customer get the coverage they need.

        <p>
         To help motivate the team and have some fun, I created a Bingo game for us to play.  As we took calls throughout the week, we would mark off the bingo sheet for anything that applied to each call. In the end everyone had fun and it helped support some of the habits that might be hard to remember.
